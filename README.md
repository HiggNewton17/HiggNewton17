- 👋 Hi, I’m @HiggNewton17 - aka T.J. Higgins. A couple of years ago, I was working as an aircaft mechanic. I started learning web-design and development around that time and have been hooked ever since. Nowadays, I work as a Search Engine Optimization Specialist whilst pursuing a front end dev position. 

- 👀 I’m extremely interested in alternative technology and hope to launch my own open source project very soon!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Front-End development in general. I've built quite a few websites on no-code platforms (Webflow, Duda, Wordpress etc.) but really want to learn how to custom-code anything I can imagine. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner-friendly React applications and a React app I plan to make open source soon!
